        <h3 id="timeline">Here's the timeline of Alan Turing's life:</h3>
        <ul id="list">
          <li><p><b>1912</b>: Alan Mathison Turing is born in Maida Vale, London, England.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1928–1931</b>: Turing studies at Sherborne School, displaying exceptional aptitude in mathematics.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1931–1934</b>: Turing continues his education at King's College, Cambridge, where he studies mathematics.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1936</b>: Turing publishes his seminal paper "On Computable Numbers," introducing the concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical model of computation.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1938–1939</b>: Turing works at the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, where he contributes to breaking the German Enigma code during World War II.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1945</b>: Turing is awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his wartime services.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1946</b>: Turing designs the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), an early concept for a stored-program computer.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1950</b>: Turing publishes "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," proposing the Turing Test as a measure of artificial intelligence.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1952</b>: Turing is arrested and charged with "gross indecency" for his homosexuality, which was criminalized in the UK at the time.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1952</b>: Turing undergoes chemical castration as an alternative to imprisonment.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1954</b>: Alan Turing dies by cyanide poisoning. The official cause of death is suicide, though there has been ongoing speculation and debate.</p></li>

<li><p><b>1966</b>: The term "Turing machine" is officially coined in honor of Alan Turing's contributions to theoretical computer science.</p></li>

<li><p><b>2013</b>: Turing is granted a posthumous royal pardon for his conviction for homosexuality.</p></li>

<li><p><b>2019</b>: The Bank of England announces that Alan Turing will be featured on the new £50 banknote.</p></li>

          <p>"We are not interested in the fact that the brain has the consistency of cold porridge. Nor are we interested in the fact that in any computer that is actually working, the movements of the electrons are more like a long slow river, than like the rapid vibrations of a tuned string. We are interested in the eventual ability of machines to make decisions which will damage man as little as possible. As for me, the machine is not alive until it has that ability."</p>
